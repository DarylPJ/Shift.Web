# shift.Web

This is a web app using next.js written in typescript. It is a shift pattern web app for my family to use to keep track of when my dad is working. There are setting the choose between different coloured shift patterns. The selection made is stored in local storage so it doesnâ€™t need to be configured each time.

The app is hosted on netlify and can be viewed [here](https://shiftpattern.netlify.app/)
